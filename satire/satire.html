    <p>A 2024 analysis found that there is a small increase of real-world violence and aggression in individuals who do not engage in any video games, especially violent video games. The analysis, led by professor Andrew Tate of Hustlers University, aims to provide non-bias data from a group of 24,000 individuals from all backgrounds. 
    </p>
    <p>Video games are not only a globally successful industry but also a major part of many people’s childhood and lives. Numerous studies over decades have demonstrated video games’ ability to regulate and safely release a person’s emotions. Violent video games in particular are very popular among those working in high stress environments as it lets people release any pent up emotions over a visual screen instead of the real-world.
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Tate’s study seeks to determine the exact statistics that correspond with participants’ past and current engagement with video games or lack thereof. Of the 24,000 participants, 96% reported to have played games in their childhood, 92% are currently playing games, and 2% reported that they have never or rarely played video games. Among those who are currently playing video games only one is a convicted felony, charged with aggravated assault. While more than 50 indivuals who never or rarely play video games are convicted felons, with some even charged with manslaughter!
    </p>
    <p>The individual charged with aggravated assault, who wishes to remain anonymous, claims that their previous actions were due to a long absence of video games during a particularly harsh time in their life. They also claim, “Ever since I switched to regularly playing violent video games, I have been able to stabilize my mood”. This individual had since been promoted to supervisor in their job with a promotion lining up in the next few months.
    </p>

      <p><i>“Ever since I switched to regularly playing violent video games, I have been able to stabilize my mood."</i></p>
      <p>-Anonymous</p>
    </div>
    <p>Meanwhile, the 50 individuals who have never played video games acknowledge that it’s harder for them to control their emotions compared to their peers and families. Over 60% of these individuals claim that they cannot keep a job for more than a year due to their attitude in work while the rest either work remotely or are unemployed. 
    </p>
    <p> During his study, Dr.Tate had convinced more than 200 of the 483 individuals who never played video games to give them a try. After half a year of observation, more than 95% of individuals reported having better moods and views on life, 30% of individuals also reported having found a better job or were promoted due to their work ethics.
    </p>
    <p>This study shows the undeniable effects of videogames on people and the benefits they received from them. It also shows how those who do not play video games are inherently more prone to physical violence and unstable mood shifts. Dr. Tate’s recent study affirm the apparent benefit of videogames on society and individuals, not only emotionally but also monetarily.
